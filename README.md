# Apple Store Applications, SQL-project
### Welcome to the Apple Store Application Data Exploration project! In this repository, I've utilized SQL as the primary tool to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the Apple Store dataset. The main objectives of this project include:
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Leveraging SQL, I've delved deep into the dataset, unraveling its intricacies to gain valuable insights into the Apple Store applications.
* Appending Datasets: To enrich the dataset, I've incorporated additional data, enhancing the depth and breadth of our analysis.
* Insight Discovery: Through rigorous SQL queries, I've uncovered valuable insights that shed light on various aspects of the Apple Store applications.
* Final Recommendations: Drawing from the analysis, I'll conclude the project by providing actionable recommendations based on the discovered patterns and trends.

### The analysis will address key data questions, such as:
* Checking for Null values in the Apple Store dataset.
* Determining the number of apps per gender in the Apple Store.
* Providing an overview of the pricing structure within the Apple Store.
* Investigating the currencies accepted for app purchases.
* Assessing whether paid apps exhibit higher ratings compared to free ones.
* Exploring the correlation between the number of languages supported and app ratings.
* Identifying apps with poor ratings based on gender.
* Analyzing the correlation between the length of the app description and its rating.
* Highlighting the top apps for each gender.
  
Stay tuned for an engaging journey through the realm of Apple Store applications, where SQL acts as our guiding tool for comprehensive data exploration and analysis!
